## **Next Steps / Future Improvements**
While our current model provides an approach to estimating ejection fraction (EF) using machine learning techniques, there are several areas for improvement and future directions.

1. Improving Feature Extraction
The choice of **ResNet18** for feature extraction prioritized texture-based patterns such as **edges, curves, and gradients**. However, this may not fully capture the **temporal dynamics** of the left ventricleâ€™s motion. To improve this:  

### **Alternative Deep Learning Models:**
- **Echonet**: A deep learning model specifically designed for echocardiography, trained on large-scale EF datasets.
- **Lidar3DCNN**: A 3D convolutional model that could capture volumetric changes more effectively.
- **TimeSformer**: A transformer-based architecture that models spatial and temporal dependencies better than CNNs.

### **Incorporating Optical Flow Features**  
- Optical flow tracks **motion dynamics** between frames, potentially improving how we model left ventricle movement during systole and diastole.
- Could be used alongside CNN features to enhance EF prediction.

## **2. Refining State Modeling (Beyond GMM-HMM)**
Our current pipeline applies **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) + Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to model state transitions. However, several enhancements could be explored:

### **Alternative State Modeling Techniques:**
- **Deep Hidden Markov Models (DeepHMM)**: Uses neural networks to model latent state transitions more effectively.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or LSTMs**: Can learn **temporal dependencies** in EF progression without requiring discrete states.
- **Transformer-based Sequence Models**: Could improve performance by better handling long-term dependencies.

### **Adaptive State Learning**
- Instead of **predefining the number of states**, use a **data-driven approach** to learn the **optimal number of EF states dynamically**.
- Why Avoid Predefining States?
    - Cardiac motion is complex and varies across patients, meaning that a fixed number of states may oversimplify or overcomplicate the EF estimation process.
    - Different patients have different ventricular motion characteristics.
    - Due to iime-dependent changes in EF, using a fixed number of states may fail to capture gradual changes in EF dynamics.
